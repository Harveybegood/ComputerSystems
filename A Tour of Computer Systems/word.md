Question of "Word"

Regarding the word in computer system which has confused me long time. here are descriptions from context   
" Buses are typically designed to transfer fixed-size chunks of bytes known as words. The number of bytes in a word (the word size) is 
 fundamental system parameter that varies across systems. Most machines today have word sizes of either 4 bytes(32 bits) or 8 bytes(64 bits)"
 
 To understand: there are more capacity of bytes in a word, the better performance a PC has. take a metaphor as that the wider a river,
 the more flow for water at the same time.
